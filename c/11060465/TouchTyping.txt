When I look up to the stars, there’s a burning deep inside me, 
and I feel a power growing in my soul.
There is something I can sense, deep within a dream to guide me, 
and I know that I am reaching for my goal.
I can do anything at all, I can climb the highest mountain, 
I can feel the ocean calling wild and free.
I can be anything I want, with this hope to drive me onward, 
if I can just believe in me.
When the skies are dark and grey, we still know the sun is shining: 
though it’s out of sight, its light is glowing still.
And as long as I believe, there is nothing I can’t wish for; 
not a dream that I’m unable to fulfill.
I can do anything at all, I can climb the highest mountain, 
I can feel the ocean calling wild and free.
I can be anything I want, with this hope to drive me onward, 
if I can just believe in me.
And whatever it takes I’ll find it somehow; 
whatever it needs I’ll show I’m strong.
Whatever it takes I’ll make it happen: 
Finding out where I belong.
While the world is spinning round, I can sometimes lose direction, 
and I know how hard it is to find my way.
But with friends around to care, there is nothing I can’t handle, 
and I’ll face the future treasuring each day.
I can do anything at all, I can climb the highest mountain, 
I can feel the ocean calling wild and free.
I can be anything I want, with this hope to drive me onward, 
if I can just believe… in me.
